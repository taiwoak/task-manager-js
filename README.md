| `Array.reverse()`    | Reverse the list of tasks                                        |
| `Array.reduce()`     | Count total characters in task names                             |
| `Array.some()`       | Check if **any** tasks are completed                             |
| `Array.every()`      | Check if **all** tasks are completed                             |
| `String.includes()`  | Live search filter with partial match                            |
